    "While drawing rectangles and adding text is my primary job, I’m also driven by curiosity and constantly find myself diving into new topics—from AI and photography to video making—always exploring ways to expand my perspective and creativity. Outside of work, I’m a husband, a father of three amazing (and wild) kids, and when I finally get a moment to myself, you’ll either find me playing console games or winding down with a good book on my eReader.",
